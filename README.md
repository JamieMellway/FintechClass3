## Description ##

### Who are you? What is your background? ###

Hi, I'm Jamie Mellway.  I'm a Senior Technical Systems Analyst at RBC.  Degrees in Physics and Philosophy.  

### What are your career goals? ###

My project at work used lots of legacy technology and is being retired.  When I hear about most of the projects on our floor, I'm stuck scribbling down acronyms to look up later.  Looking to start getting a handle on ML, NLG, PANDAS, etc so I have more options around the office.

### Why did you choose FinTech as a career path? ###

Started working at RBC five years ago and looking to expand within our team.
